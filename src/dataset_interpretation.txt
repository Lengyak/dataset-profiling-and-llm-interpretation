AUTOMATED DATASET INTERPRETATION
=============================================

Executive summary:
The dataset contains 11 numerical features with high variance and 1 feature with zero variance and high missing ratio. Most of the features have a skewness towards the right side, indicating that they are positively skewed.

Detected risks:

- **High Variance**: 
  - Column_name: radius_worst
    Min Value: 7.93
    Max Value: 36.04
    Mean: 16.27

- **Zero Variance**:
  - Column_name: Unnamed: 32
    Quality Warnings: zero_variance, high_missing_ratio

- **High Missing Ratio**:
  - Column_name: Unnamed: 32
    NaN Count: 569

Recommended actions:

- Scale the features with high variance using StandardScaler or RobustScaler to improve model performance.
- Drop the feature with zero variance as it does not provide any information and may cause issues in the analysis.
- Handle missing values in the dataset by either imputing them or removing the rows with missing values.
